## Introduction

The SUSHI Project is an umbrella project for all the [SODA Foundtion Project](https://sodafoundation.io/) NorthBound Plugins, for OpenStack, Kubernetes, Mesos, VMware and more. The plugins themselves could have multiple hosting location, however the OpenSDS Sushi Project repo should always have the most up-to-date version.

Sushi will also seek to collaborate with other upstream open source communities such as Cloud Native Computing Foundation, Docker, OpenStack, and Open Container Initiative.
